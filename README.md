# 🗳️ VoteChain

VoteChain is not your ordinary voting system—it's a dynamic and secure blockchain-based voting solution implemented in Go (Golang). 🚀 This project is on a mission to showcase the power of blockchain technology in ensuring the integrity and transparency of the election process. Each block in the blockchain is a treasure trove of votes, and with a clever system in place, double voting is as impossible as finding a unicorn in your backyard! 🦄✨

## Features
- **Voter Registration:** 📋 Register voters by adding them to the system.
- **Candidate Registration:** 🎉 Register candidates and initialize their vote counts.
- **Casting Votes:** 🗳️ Allow registered voters to cast votes for their preferred candidates.
- **Double Voting Prevention:** 🚫 Ensure that voters can cast only one vote, preventing double voting.
- **Election Results:** 🏆 Calculate and display the winner of the election.
- **Blockchain Integrity:** 🔒 Use blockchain technology to maintain the integrity and transparency of the election process.

## Usage
1. **Initialize the blockchain** with a genesis block.
2. **Register candidates and voters** using the provided functions.
3. **Simulate the voting process** by casting votes for candidates.
4. **Calculate and display the election results.** 📊
5. **Explore the blockchain structure** and view the details of each block.

## Blockchain Structure
The blockchain consists of blocks, each containing:
- `PrevHash`: The hash of the previous block.
- `CurrentHash`: The hash of the current block.
- `Votes`: An array of votes recorded in the block.

## Example
```go
// Code snippet demonstrating the usage of the VoteChain system
// ...

// Simulate voting process
CastVote(1, "Candidate A")
CastVote(2, "Candidate B")
// ...

// Calculate and display election results
CalculateElectionResults()

// Display the blockchain
// ...

```
